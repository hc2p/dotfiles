# dotfiles

Before doing anything, make sure you know what are you doing! Settings applied by this repository are very personal, and definitely not suite everyones needs. I suggest to create your own set of dotfiles based on this repo.

1. Install [brew](https://brew.sh/).
2. Clone this repo to a hidden .dotfile directory in your home directory

```
git clone git@github.com:hc2p/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfile
```

4. Run setup.

```
source ~/.dotfiles/setup-symlinks.sh
```

```
source ~/.dotfiles/setup-macos.sh
```

```
source ~/.dotfiles/setup-brew.sh
```
